 "Mr. Wilkens, we regret to inform you that we have news regarding your wife," one trooper began.  "Tell me! Did you find her?" Wilkens blurted out, anxiously.  The troopers exchanged glances. One spoke, "We have some bad news, some good news, and some fantastic news. Which would you like to hear first?"  Bracing himself, a pale Mr. Wilkens responded, "Give me the bad news."  The trooper said, "I'm sorry, sir, but we recovered your wife's body in Kachemak Bay this morning."  "Oh no!" gasped Wilkens.  After a moment, he gathered himself and asked, "So, what's the good news?"  The trooper explained, "Well, when we brought her up, she had 12 twenty-five-pound king crabs and six large Dungeness crabs attached to her. We're confident youâ€™re entitled to a share of the catch."  Stunned, Wilkens asked, "If that's the good news, then what's the fantastic news?"  With a straight face, the trooper replied, "We're pulling her up again tomorrow."
