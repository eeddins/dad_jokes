As we were putting out cookies for Santa on Christmas Eve, I accidentally dropped one. "No problem," I said, picking it up and dusting it off before placing it back on the plate."You can't do that," argued my four-year-old."Don't worry. Santa will never know."He shot me a look. "So he knows if I've been bad or good, but he doesn't know if you dropped a cookie on the floor?"
