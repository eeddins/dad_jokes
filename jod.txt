 His parents are immediately suspicious, knowing there's no way his after-school job could have paid for such an expensive car. "Where did you get that car?" they shout, astonished.  "I bought it today," the boy replies calmly.  "With what money?" his mom demands. "We know how much a Porsche costs, and there's no way you can afford it!"  The boy shrugs. "It’s used, and I got a great deal. I only paid $20 for it."  His parents are even more shocked. "Who would sell a Porsche for $20?!"  "The woman up the street," the boy explains. "She just moved in. I delivered a pizza to her, and she offered to sell me the Porsche for $20."  Baffled, his parents rush to the neighbor’s house, ready for an explanation. They find her calmly planting flowers in her yard. "I'm the father of the boy you sold a Porsche to for $20," the dad says. "We need to know why you sold it so cheap!"  The woman, without looking up, responds, "I got a call from my husband this morning. I thought he was on a business trip in Florida, but it turns out he ran off to Hawaii with his secretary and doesn't plan on coming back."  The boy's mom, still confused, asks, "But what does that have to do with selling our son a Porsche for $20?"  With a satisfied smile, the woman replies, "My husband told me to sell his new Porsche and send him the money—so I did."
