 Being a devout Christian, he falls to his knees and prays: "God, if it lies within your will, please send me a way to get home tonight!".  To his astonishment, there is a swirl of ethereal music, and an angel descends from the clouds, and moments later a shiny black Audi appears where it wasn't before. "Hail, thou who has found favour with the Lord!" proclaims the angel. "Here is your way home" - and the angel hands him the keys to the Audi.  An hour or so later, the mathematician is parking outside his house, and he once again kneels and prays, "Lord, who has heard my prayer and been gracious unto me, I now ask that you take back this gift. I only wanted to get home, and you have done all that I could have asked - so let me not be tempted by the desire for material gains."  There is another swirl of ethereal music, and a still more glorious creature appears. The mathematician bows reverently, and says "Have I the honour of addressing Michael, or are you Gabriel?"  "Why do you ask?" says the radiant figure.  "Because," says the mathematician, "if you are here to undo the function of an angel, you must be an arcangel."
