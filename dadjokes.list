["Sometimes... when you cry... no one sees your tears .Sometimes... when you are worried... no one sees your pain.Sometimes... when you are happy... no one sees your smile.But fart just one time...", " The boys\u2019 mother heard that a preacher in town had been successful in disciplining children, so she asked if he would speak with her boys. The preacher agreed, but he asked to see them individually. The mother sent the 8 year old in the morning, with the older boy to see the preacher in the afternoon. The preacher, a huge man with a deep booming voice, sat the younger boy down and asked him sternly, \"Do you know where God is, son?\"  The boy\u2019s mouth dropped open, but he made no response, sitting there wide-eyed with his mouth hanging open. So the preacher repeated the question in an even sterner tone, \"Where is God?!\" Again, the boy made no attempt to answer. The preacher raised his voice even more and shook his finger in the boy\u2019s face and bellowed, \u201cWhere is God?!\" The boy screamed & bolted from the room, ran directly home and dove into his closet, slamming the door behind him. When his older brother found him in the closet, he asked \"What happened?\"  The younger brother, gasping for breath, replied, \"We are in BIG trouble this time!\" \"GOD is missing, and they think WE did it!\"\t\n\n\t#joke #mother \n\tRead more on page https://jokesoftheday.net\n", "Customer: \"Waiter, waiter, what\u2019s this fly doing in my soup?\"The waiter leans forward to get a better look.Waiter: \u201cLooks like the backstroke, sir.\u201d", " \"Hey John, I need you to take care of my cat for 3 months\".  \"Three months?!\"  \"Yeah, but don't worry, all you need to do is feed her a 3 times a day, change her sand, play with her a bit and, god forbid, take her to the vet if she needs anything\".  \"Damn, so... what if she...\"  \"I have a plan for that too.
