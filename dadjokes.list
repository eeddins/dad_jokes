[" He pulls over and after messing about with the engine trying to fix it, covering himself in oils and grime, he calls for a mechanic, they tell him they can come in just under an hour to asses the situation.  Dismayed, he also calls his boss to let him know what has happened. His boss informs him that the destination of delivery is simply up the road and asks him to carry the coffin the rest of the way. Upset but recognising the fact that he has nothing better to do, he picks up the coffin and starts dragging it with him up the road. A police officer sees this and approaches him, asking \"what are you doing with that coffin? Where are you going?\".

The adventurer inquires as to what is going on.  \"The elephant, sir,\" explains the pygmy. \"The elephant has gone mad. 'Tis terrible. Elephants are wise and friendly, but when an elephant goes mad, it destroys everything in its path. It cannot be reasoned with, no sir, and it cannot be helped in any way. Unfortunately, when it happens, the elephant has to be put down.\"  The adventurer inquires, \"But how did you kill such a gigantic animal?\"  \"I killed it with a club,\" helpfully explains the pygmy.  \"It must have been a big club,\" observes the adventurer.  \"Yes, sir, a very big club indeed,\" says the pygmy. \"We have over 300 members!\"\t\n\n\t#joke #animal #elephant \t\n\tRead more on page https://jokesoftheday.net\n", "While giving a physical the doctor noticed that his patient\u2019s shins were covered with dark bruises.\u201cTell me,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cdo you play hockey or soccer?\u201d\u201cNeither,\u201d said the man. \u201cMy wife and I play bridge.\u201d", " One night while at the club he overhears some gentleman talking. One tells a story of going on an African safari where he killed a lion, the head of which he had mounted and placed in his study. A second gentleman mentions a trip to the Yukon to investigate their gold prospecting operation and while there he downed a large elk whose antlers he mounted above the fireplace in his living room. A third gentleman tells a story about going to their estate in India where he killed a tiger from the back of an elephant and had it made into a rug he put in his bedroom.  Our British gentleman hears these stories and realizes that to keep up appearances he will need to take an excursion and down some sort of big game himself. So he makes arrangements, getting supplies and chartering a ship to Africa. Once arriving he finds a guide who speaks English and some other men to carry his belongings and they make their way into the dark jungle.  As they trek through the jungle, cutting down the heavy foliage with machetes, they begin to hear a sound in the distance. As the get further in the British gentleman begins to make out that it's the sound of drumming, and assumes that it's some local tribe having some sort of celebration, and as his companions don't seem concerned he assumes it's not something that will become an issue.  As they progress through the jungle and the day becomes late the drumming has increased in volume and intensity. After making camp and preparing their meals the Englishman is getting a bit nervous and asks the guide if the drumming is something they should be concerned with. The guide waves a hand and says \"Not to worry. The only time to worry is if the drumming stops.\"  During the next day as they make their way through the jungle the drumming continues to intensify. By the time they make their camp on the second night the drumming has grown so loud that it's drowning out every other noise in the jungle. No birds, insects, nothing can be heard.  Very suddenly, the drumming stops, absolutely stone cold silence. The Englishman bolts up frantically grabbing the guide and asks \"That's bad isn't it? You said the drumming stopping was bad!?\"  The guide shakes his head and says \"It's absolutely terrible. It means it's time for the accordion solo.\"\t\n\n\t#joke #animal #bird #tiger #lion #elephant #food #meal \t\n\tRead more on page https://jokesoftheday.net\n", "Why did the ballplayer bring a rope to the game?He wanted to tie the score.", " The first man starts describing his story, \u201cwell i jumped from 5,000ft and was supposed to pull my parachute at 2,500ft but when I did, nothing happened.
